# Some of my old ""projects""

Most are broken or half baked, except for randomwalks.py.
Uses pygame and turtle modules.    




### anothergame.py
Was supposed to be a boids simulation, gave up trying to get the math and performance right.  

Mouse is supposed to repel boids, space to turn repulsion off until mouse moves again.

### graph.py
Just a simple moving sinewave in Turtle graphics.

### randomwalks.py
Generates cool patterns using simple brownian motion.  User must enter a random seed first.  

W/A/S/D - Movement  
R/f - Zoom  
Up/Down Arrow  - Increment/Decrement current seed  

### sdgk.py
Also generates cool patterns, but with a 'pencil' line attached to many other lines, all spinning at a constant rate.  Pattern is random each time. No idea why I named it sdgk.  

SPACE - Clear lines to improve performance

### tictactoe.py
Two - Player tictactoe using numpad keys. Self-explanatory.

### untitled.py
Turtle that bounces around in a box. That's all.  

Up/Down Arrow - Forward/Reverse  
Left/Right Arrow  - Turn Left/Right (HOLD)
